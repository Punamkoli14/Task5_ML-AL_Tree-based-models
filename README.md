# Task5_ML-AL_Tree-based-models
I have completed my 5rd task of AI & ML INTERNSHIP of Elevate Lab.In this project worked on a real-world dataset of HeartDisease.
Project worked on using clinical and personal attributes like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.
📊 Goal: Assist early detection and risk analysis using AI tools in healthcare.

 📌 Features of the Dataset
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar, Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina, Oldpeak (ST depression)

  🧹 Preprocessing Steps
- Handled categorical values (`M`/`B` → `1`/`0`)
- Scaled continuous variables using `StandardScaler`
- Split into training and test sets

🔍Built and compared ML models:
Decision Tree: 72%
Random Forest: 83%

📌 Tools Used: Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn ,Machine Learning
